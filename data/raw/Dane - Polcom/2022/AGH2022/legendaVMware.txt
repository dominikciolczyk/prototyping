Z uwagi na to, że w naszej infrastrukturze klastry różnią się wersjami vcenter opis poszczególnych parametrów może się różnić.
Poniżej znajdują się opisy parametrów takich zasobów jak CPU, RAM, DISK oraz NETWORK. Jeśli są podane w nazwy parametrów oraz 2 opisy tego parametru to pierwszy z nich zawsze dotyczy nowszej wersji vcenter, drugi natomiast starszej wersji vcenter.

* to parametr dostępny tylko w niektórych wersjach vcenter

[CPU]
Usage - CPU usage as a percentage during the interval

Usage in MHz - CPU usage in megahertz during the interval 

Total* - Total amount of CPU resources of all hosts in the cluster

Reserved capacity* - Total CPU capacity reserved by the virtual machines


[MEMORY]
Active* (KB) - Amount of guest physical memory that is being actively read or written by guest. Activeness is estimated by ESXi

Balloned memory/Ballon - Amount of guest physical meory reclaimed from the virtual machine by the baloon driver in the guest/Amount of memory allocated by the virtual machine meory control driver (vmmemctl), which is installed with VMware Tools

Consumed - Amount of host physical memory consumed for backing up guest physical memory pages/Amount of host physical memory consumed by a virtual machine, host, or cluster

Granted* (KB) - Amount of host physical memory or physical memory that is mapped for a virtual machine or a host

Overhead consumed/Overhead - Host physical memory consumed by ESXi data structures for running the virtual machines/Host physical memory (KB) consumed by the virtualzation infrastructure for running the virtual machine

Host consumed % / Usage - Percentage of host physical memory that has been consumed/Memory usage as percentage of total configured or available memory

Shared* (KB) - Amount of guest physical memory that is shared within a single virtual machine or across virtual machines

Compressed* - Compressed Average KB compressed Absolute Guest physical memory pages that have undergone memory compression


[DISK]

Read rate* (KBps) - Average number of kilobytes read from the disk each second during the collection interval

Usage (KBps) - Aggregated disk I/O rate. For hosts, this metric includes the rates for all virtual machines running on the host during the collection interval.

Write rate* (KBps) - Average number of kilobytes written to disk each second during the collection interval



[NETWORK]

Usage (KBps) - Network utilization (combined transmit-rates and receive-rates) during the interval

Data receive rate* (KBps) - Data receive rate Average KBps received Rate Average rate at which data was received during the interval

Data transmit rate* (KBps) - Data transmit rate Average KBps transmitted Rate Average rate at which data was transmitted during the interval
